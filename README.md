# The aNG - Digital Rights Hackathon for International Human Centric Data Controls

## Hackathon Project Stream 1 ** Digital Rights - Master Rights Contracts for Cascading Master Data Legal Control standards **
1. Operational Privacy Notice Agreement - producing next generational modular privacy agreement clauses that can be used to overwrite terms of use and exising contracts 

Instructions
* select (or create) a topic/issues/item from the Privacy Agreement Clause List   
* use the reference material for making Privacy Agreement Clauseses - (add to the reference material for making a clause)
* write a clause that can be used to replace/supercede the surveillance by design with consent by design (e.g consent before surveillance) 
* conribute the clause to proposed - International GitLaw - OPN Clause Repository- (and contribute to the proposal)-OCG-OPN-Ctrl-Repo

Resources 
* Consent Type Rights Profile Matrix for GDPR (and alternative CoE 108+)
* Clause Ref Material: Operational Privacy Notice & Consent Receipt V1.2 (consolidated version) - Combines ISO 29100 + 29184 controls for innovation 
* Select an OPN Clause to make from the OPN Hack List Matrix - find an issue needs Privacy Agreement Clauses e.g. transparent surviellance by desing and surveillance by consent for the proportional safeguards (see PIPEDA Principal 7 and Meaningful Consent Law) with the use identity management technologies.
*  Hack Sub-Challenge -- Find an invalid contract cluse in privacy policies or Terms of Use that violate privacy by design - e.g. meta-data, AI and make a clause

## Hackathon Project Stream 2 ** Extending Federated Privacy Contract Framework (GA4GH) with OPN ** 

Overall Objective of this hack:
goal is to implement modular data governance agreements in CCS format, and to connect that with standards for documents, ontologies and technologies that implement them.

We'll work from a couple of directions towards a full solution.

1. From a modular data sharing agreement.

2. From common ontologies.

2.1. High Level Entities:

2.1.1.  Persons - Entities, Humans

2.1.2.  Places

2.1.3.  Things

2.1.4.  Relationships

Instructions for hack activities
* Generate modular decentralised data governance agreement in CCS format that match or improve upon the security and privacy of GA4GH using the OPN-For A GA4GH Transprency Framework  -

* contribute to A decentralised governance code of conduct and privacy agreement cluase based practices for GA4GH 
* solve (or contribute to a list of hack challenges)
